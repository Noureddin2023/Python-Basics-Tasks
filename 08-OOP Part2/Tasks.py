# 1. Create a new class names SciCalc with 3 methods , sum , mull , power all of them takes 2 argument x, y
class SciValc:
    def sum(x,y):
        pass
    def mull(x,y):
        pass
    def power(x,y)



# 2. Sum return the sum of x and y





# 3. Mull return the multiplication of x and y




# 4. The power return x power y




# 5. Take an object from the class and call the 3 methods with any numbers




# 6. Can we inherit from the class we created in the first task Calc




# 7. Inherit from the Calc class , now remove the unneeded code the the SciCalc after inheriting




# 8. call the 3 methods again from the SciCalc object




# 9. Now you should see the same result as before




# 10. Explain in few words what happened after inheriting
