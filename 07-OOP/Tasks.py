# 1 : Explain in few words what we mean by a class give and example
'''
A class is a code template for creating objects. Objects have member variables and have behaviour associated with them. In python a class is created by the keyword class . An object is created using the constructor of the class. This object will then be called the instance of the class

Example: Apple : iphone 14:

(Class) - Design:
          - Color  Red , Gold
          - Size    Normal Max
(Object)- Production:
          - Color  Gold
          - Size   Normal Max

# 2 : Create a simple class names calculator

class Calculator:
    def nour(n,x,y):
        print(x+y)

m = Calculator()
m.nour(5,7)




# 3 : Create a constructor that prints Welcome message
class Calculator:


    def __init__(self):
        print('Welcom')

m = Calculator()        



# 4 : Add 2 methods to the class & mull

class Calculator:
    def sum():
        

    def mull():
    


# 5 : The sum method return the sum of 2 arguments x and y

class Calculator:
    def sum(x,y):
        result = x+y
        return result

# 6 : The mull method return the multiplication of the arguments x and y

class Calculator:
    def sum(x,y):
        result = x+y
        return result
    
    def mull(x,y):
        result = x+y
        return result

# 7 : Take an object from the class Calculator:
class Calculator:
    def sum(x,y):
        result = x+y
        return result
    
    def mull(x,y):
        result = x+y
        return result
c = Calculator    



# 8 : Call the sum method with 10 , 20




# 9 : Call the mull method with 10 , 20
