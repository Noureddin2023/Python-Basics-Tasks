# 1 : What is the differences between = , ==
'''
    = : creat variable
   == : Question
'''
# 2 : What do we mean by using !=
'''
   !=: not equal to operator
'''
# 3 : What is the operator precedence
'''
    operator precedence affects how an expression is evaluted and listed following:
    ()
    **
    * /
    + -
'''
# 4 : Create a variable x with value of 10
'''
    x = 10
'''

# 5 : Increase x value by 15 using assignment operators
'''
    x = x + 15
    x
    25
'''

# 6 : Divide the x value by 5 using assignment operators
'''
    x /= 5
    x
    2.0
'''

# 7 : Multiplay the x value by 10 using assignment operators
'''
    x*=10
    x
    100
'''

# 8 : Get module of x on 3 using assignment operators
'''
   x%=3
   x
   1
'''

# 9 : Using python print the module of 11 to 4
'''

'''

# 10 : Print the exponent of 2,3
'''
     2**3
      8
'''

# 11 : Divide 11 by 3 using python division
'''
     11/3
     3.6666666666666665

     11//3
     3
'''
