# 1 : Create a Boolean variable nammed x
x = False
x = True
# 2 : Create an integer variable named y
y = 7
y_x = 7
y2 = 7
# 3 : Create a float variable named z
z = 5,5
# 4 : Create a string variable names s
s = 'nour'
s = "nour"
s = '''nour'''
# 5 : Convert the int variable to float
s = 12
type(s)
<class 'int'>
s = 12/4
type(s)
<class 'float'>
# 6 : Can we convert the str to int ?
yes,we can:
s = '50'
s = int('50')
type(s)
<class 'int'>
# 7 : Create a list of numbers from 1 to 5
n = [1,2,3,4,5]
# 8 : Create a tuple from 10 to 15
n = (10,11,12,13,14,15)
# 9 : Convert the list to tuple
s = ['nour']
s = ['nour'],['mohamed']
type(s)
<class 'tuple'>
# 10 : Create a dict of 3 values
n = {'nour':20 , 'mohamed':25 , 'mahmoud':30 }
# 11 : Can we use semi colon; with python ?
we canÂ´t use the semi colon, In Python Semicoln is not used to denote the end of the line.
# 12 : Python is interpreted or compiled ?
Python is interpreted

# 13 : What is the differences between low level & high level ?
                                High Level                Low Level

    Basic                    Programmer amiable         Machinefriendly
          
Speed of execution                Fast                       Slow

  Translation                   Requires                   Assembler
                       compiler or an interpreter     is required while machine language is directly executed
                     
Memory efficiency                Low                         High

Comprehensibility           Understandable            Hard to understand

 Portability and
machine dependency     Portable and runnable in any  Nonprtable and machine dependent
                           Platforms

Debugging and                Simple                          Quite complex
